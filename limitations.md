# Limitations

This project is exploratory and is intended to study the stability and reliability of genetic variant interpretations rather than to make clinical predictions. Several limitations should be noted.

## Reliance on public metadata

All analyses rely on publicly available ClinVar metadata. This work does not include access to underlying patient-level data, laboratory pipelines or unpublished evidence that may influence expert interpretation.

## Interpretations are dynamic by design

Reclassification of variants can occur for multiple reasons, including new experimental evidence, evolving clinical guidelines and changes in expert consensus. The instability signals studied here are correlational and should not be interpreted as causal explanations for reclassification.

## No downstream clinical validation

This project does not evaluate how instability signals affect real-world clinical decisions or patient outcomes. Assessing downstream impact would require integration with clinical workflows and longitudinal follow-up, which is beyond the scope of this work.

## Not a replacement for expert review

The analyses presented here are not intended to replace expert judgment or formal variant curation processes. Instead, they are designed to support prioritization and caution by highlighting cases where interpretations may warrant closer scrutiny.

## Scope limitations

This work focuses on interpretation stability rather than disease-specific pathogenicity, therapeutic impact or population prevalence. Conclusions should be interpreted within this narrow and intentional scope.
