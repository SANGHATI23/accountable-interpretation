# Failure Case: A High-Confidence Label with Low Stability

**Variant:** VariantID 20  
**Gene:** WDR35  
**Current ClinVar classification:** Pathogenic  
**Reclassification risk tier:** Critical  

---

## What ClinVar says today

This variant is currently classified as *Pathogenic* in ClinVar.  
The classification is presented as high confidence within the database and may reasonably be interpreted as clinically settled by downstream users.

---

## Why the interpretation appears confident

At face value, the variant carries a definitive pathogenic label.  
Such labels are often assumed to be supported by stable and well-reviewed evidence, particularly when surfaced in clinical or research pipelines.

---

## Why this interpretation is fragile

Despite the pathogenic label, several features suggest low interpretive stability:

- **Evidence staleness:** The last evaluation occurred over **15 years ago**, predating many modern population and functional datasets.
- **Limited consensus:** The classification is supported by **a single submitter**, with no evidence of independent confirmation.
- **Risk model signal:** The variant is assigned a *Critical* reclassification risk tier, indicating structural vulnerability in the supporting evidence.

Together, these factors indicate that the apparent confidence of the label may mask substantial uncertainty.

---

## What could change this classification

Several plausible updates could materially affect the interpretation:

- New population frequency data inconsistent with pathogenicity
- Additional submissions providing conflicting or refuting evidence
- Updated functional or computational analyses unavailable at the time of the original review

None of these changes require extraordinary discoveries — only routine evidence accrual.

## Why this case matters

This variant illustrates how **high-confidence labels are not always high-stability interpretations**.  
It motivates the need for systematic re-review prioritization to ensure that legacy classifications remain aligned with current evidence standards.

This example is intended to demonstrate prioritization logic, not to make clinical claims or recommendations.
