### Phase 6 — Prospective Validation (T0 → T1)

Using two temporally separated ClinVar releases, we evaluated whether reclassification risk scores computed at T0 were associated with observed label changes at T1. Reclassification rates varied across predicted risk tiers, reflecting both intrinsic interpretive uncertainty and real-world curation dynamics. This analysis demonstrates that reclassification is not purely a function of predicted risk, but also of review behavior and evidence accrual over time.
